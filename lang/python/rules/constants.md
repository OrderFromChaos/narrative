## Constant placement

Name every magic number. (Q09) Then place it by this test:

> Could someone change this value safely knowing only what the program **does**, or would they need
> to understand how the function **works**?

The latter is an implementation detail and belongs **inside** the function, still `ALL_CAPS`. Put
`MAGIC`, `HEADER_FORMAT`, a padding byte, a derived size, a checksum mask, and the SQL of a single
function inside. A log path, an archive directory, a glob, exit codes and operator-tunable timeouts
stay at module level. (R3a-12)

*No tool checks this. This is review judgement.*
